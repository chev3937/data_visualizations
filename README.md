# data_visualizations

Welcome to my Data Visualizations repo. Here you'll find an jupyter notebook and an HTML file for my Datavisualizations final project examining the caffeine content of various beverages. The dataset used can be found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heitornunes/caffeine-content-of-drinks).

Thanks!
